You must use proper JSON syntax, otherwise the website won't understand your information (and for that we will probably reject your pull request. Before submitting your file, use [jslint](http://jsonlint.com/) to check for syntax error and misplaced quotes/commas.

After you've edited your information, you're ready to "commit your file" and push it to us. To do that, you'll have to explain your changes, like so:

Then click "Commit changes" and you're done. A request will be created to add your file to the project, and we'll answer it in a bit.

### "How to Submit"'s FAQ

#### What do I use for the "picture" attribute?

We recommend using the path to your own Facebook profile picture, like so:

`"picture": "https://graph.facebook.com/<myidhere>/picture?width=400&height=400"`

replacing `<idhere>` with your own facebook id. To find your facebook id, check
